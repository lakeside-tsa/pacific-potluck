# GitHub Workflow for Managing Our Scratch Game Project

This guide outlines how our team will use GitHub tools to stay organized while building our game for the competition. We'll use [Issues](https://github.com/lakeside-tsa/pacific-potluck/issues), [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/lakeside-tsa/projects/1), and [Discussions](https://github.com/lakeside-tsa/pacific-potluck/discussions) to track tasks, manage the backlog, and collaborate on design.

## 1. GitHub Issues for To-Do Lists and Bugs

- **Create Issues**: Each task or bug gets its own issue (e.g., "Add background music" or "Fix jumping physics").
- **Use Labels**: Categorize issues with labels like `To-Do`, `In Progress`, `Bug`, and `Enhancement`.
- **Assign Issues**: Assign team members to issues for clear ownership.
- **Use Milestones**: Organize issues into milestones (e.g., Alpha Release, Beta Testing).
- **Descriptions & Screenshots**: Provide detailed descriptions and attach relevant media.

## 2. GitHub Projects for Managing the Backlog

- **Create Kanban Board**: Use columns like **Backlog**, **To-Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.
- **Prioritize Tasks**: Order tasks by importance and use labels like `High Priority`.
- **Break Down Large Tasks**: Divide big features into smaller tasks (e.g., "Create level background art").
- **Automate Actions**: Set up automation (e.g., moving issues to "In Progress" when assigned).

## 3. GitHub Discussions for Design & Team Communication

- **Create Discussion Topics**: Brainstorm ideas like "Game Storyline" or "Feature Requests".
- **Design Decisions**: Use Discussions for feedback on design elements (e.g., character art or gameplay mechanics).
- **Link to Issues/Projects**: Connect discussions to specific tasks or milestones.
- **Categories**: Organize discussions into categories like `Ideas`, `Design`, `Feedback`, and `Questions`.

## 4. Tips for Effective GitHub Use

- **Detailed Issues**: Write clear and detailed descriptions for each issue.
- **Regularly Update the Kanban Board**: Keep tasks moving between columns.
- **Document Decisions**: Use README or Discussions to track important decisions and guidelines.
