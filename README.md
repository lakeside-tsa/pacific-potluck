# 🎮 GitHub Workflow for Managing Our Scratch Game Project

This guide outlines how our team will use GitHub tools to stay organized while building our game for the competition. We'll use [Issues](https://github.com/lakeside-tsa/pacific-potluck/issues), [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/lakeside-tsa/projects/1), and [Discussions](https://github.com/lakeside-tsa/pacific-potluck/discussions) to track tasks, manage the backlog, and collaborate on design. 🚀

## 1. 📝 GitHub Issues for To-Do Lists and Bugs

- **Create Issues**: Each task or bug gets its own issue (e.g., "Add background music 🎶" or "Fix jumping physics 🤸").
- **Use Labels**: Categorize issues with labels like `To-Do`, `In Progress`, `Bug 🐞`, and `Enhancement ✨`.
- **Assign Issues**: Assign team members to issues for clear ownership. 👥
- **Use Milestones**: Organize issues into milestones (e.g., Alpha Release 🅰️, Beta Testing 🅱️).
- **Descriptions & Screenshots**: Provide detailed descriptions and attach relevant media (screenshots, GIFs, etc.). 📸

## 2. 📋 GitHub Projects for Managing the Backlog

- **Create Kanban Board**: Use columns like **Backlog** 📥, **To-Do** ✅, **In Progress** ⚙️, and **Done** 🎉.
- **Prioritize Tasks**: Order tasks by importance and use labels like `High Priority 🔥`.
- **Break Down Large Tasks**: Divide big features into smaller tasks (e.g., "Create level background art 🎨").
- **Automate Actions**: Set up automation (e.g., moving issues to "In Progress" when assigned). 🤖

## 3. 💬 GitHub Discussions for Design & Team Communication

- **Create Discussion Topics**: Brainstorm ideas like "Game Storyline 📜" or "Feature Requests 💡".
- **Design Decisions**: Use Discussions for feedback on design elements (e.g., character art 🎭 or gameplay mechanics 🎮).
- **Link to Issues/Projects**: Connect discussions to specific tasks or milestones. 🔗
- **Categories**: Organize discussions into categories like `Ideas 💭`, `Design 🎨`, `Feedback 💬`, and `Questions ❓`.

## 4. 🚀 Tips for Effective GitHub Use

- **Detailed Issues**: Write clear and detailed descriptions for each issue to avoid confusion. 📚
- **Regularly Update the Kanban Board**: Keep tasks moving between columns to stay on track! 📊
- **Document Decisions**: Use README or Discussions to track important decisions and guidelines. 📖
