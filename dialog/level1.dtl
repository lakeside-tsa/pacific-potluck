Welcome to Pacific Potluck! (press space)
Your mission is to gather ingredients and cook for the animals. 
Let me teach you about the controls.
Player 1 uses the "WASD" keys, which are on the left side of the keyboard.
Press "A" for left, "D" for right, "W" to jump, and "S" to interact with the cauldron.
Player 2 uses the arrow keys on the right side of the keyboard.
The left and right arrow keys moves, the up arrow key jumps, and the down key interacts with the cauldron.
Good luck!
