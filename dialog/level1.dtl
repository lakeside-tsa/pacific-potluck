(press space to continue)
Your mission is to gather ingredients 🥕🍅 and cook for the animals.
Let me teach you about the controls.
Player 1 uses the "WASD" keys, which are on the left side of the keyboard.
Press "A" for left ⬅️, "D" for right ➡️, "W" to jump, and "S" to interact with the cauldron.
Player 2 uses the arrow keys on the right side of the keyboard.
The left and right arrow keys move ⬅️➡️, the up arrow key jumps ⬆️, and the down key interacts with the cauldron.
Also, you will need 20 points to get to the next level.
A perfectly cooked dish is worth 3 points, while undercooked and overcooked dishes are worth 1 point.
Good luck! 🍀🍳
